## Vetra Cloud

Vetra Cloud is a decentralized app that allows individuals and institutions with wallet addresses to store, retrieve and share files in decentralized storage while incorporating Web3 and blockchain capabilities.

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡

Nowadays, individuals and most institutions rely on centralized storage providers to store and access their files and sensitize documents securely.
However, most of these services are offered at a subscription fee in order to access and store files.

For example, medical facilities and institutions rely on 3rd party cloud storage providers to keep their documents safe in a centralized manner. At times when a patient is being transfered to access advanced medical care, these facilities need to quickly access and transfer documents to the other institutions. Most of the time, they opt to use traditional methods such as Fax to securely transfer documents to the other institution.

As a result, such facilities and many other institutions not only need a secure decentralized infrastructure to keep their files safe but also a reliable protocol that allows them to quickly access and transfer their documents and files to other facilities or individuals that need access.

With the evolvement of web3 technologies and promotion of decentralized storages, such systems can be developed and hosted on blockchain with little to no monthly costs while reducing the risks of being denied access to data and also providing a reliable and secure system to transfer documents to other parties.
